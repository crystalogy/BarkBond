        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>This website is dedicated to the memory of my beloved dog, Eevee. Her journey from a scared rescue to a loving companion is a testament to the incredible resilience and capacity for love that animals possess. Eevee's mission was simple: to love and be loved. My goal is to share Eevee's legacy of love by helping rescue pets find their forever homes. Through this platform, I continue that mission by connecting pets in need with families who can provide them with the love and care that every animal deserves.</p>
