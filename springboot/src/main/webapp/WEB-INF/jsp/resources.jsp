If your pet needs a medical procedure that you can't afford, there are organizations that might be able to help. Some tips and limitations:</p><ul><li>Be aware that few, if any, organizations will pay for ongoing medication that pets will need for extended periods of time.</li><li>It is unlikely that any one organization or program will pay for expensive procedures in their entirety. So be sure to contact as many sources as possible. The grants might be very small, but they can add up if you get help from multiple sources.</li><li>Try negotiating with your veterinary clinic for a better price or the ability to finance the cost of care over time. Also, consider getting price comparisons from other providers. <a href="http://www.carecredit.com/vetmed" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CareCredit</a> provides financing for veterinary care; check its website to see whether you qualify.</li><li>If possible, contact any possible sources of pet financial assistance before procedures are done. Few sources are willing to pay bills for care that has already been provided.</li><li>Most organizations take applications only through email or online forms. If you aren 't computer-savvy, find a friend, relative, or neighbor to help you.</li><li>The inclusion of services, organizations, or programs listed below is NOT an endorsement or recommendation. We cannot vouch for these programs, and you should check them out yourself before asking for their aid.</li></ul><p>
